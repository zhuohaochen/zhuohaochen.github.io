I'm a doctoral student working at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California, supervised by Professor [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my master's degree at USC as well during which I worked with Professor [Alexander A. Sawchuk](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Sawchuk/Alexander).

My research focuses on speech & language processing, behavior signal processing, multimodal approaches and transfer learning. Iâ€™m particularly interested in NLP applications of healthcare and have extensively worked on modeling and evaluating psychotherapy conversations using computational approaches such as recurrent neural networks and transformers. You can attach more information about my research via my publications.
