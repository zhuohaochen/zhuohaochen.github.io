This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork ][this repository(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Welcome to Zhuohao's Homepage!
======
I'm a doctoral student working at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California, supervised by Professor [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my master's degree at USC as well during which I worked with Professor [Alexander A. Sawchuk](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Sawchuk/Alexander).

My research focuses on speech & language processing, behavior signal processing, multimodal approaches and transfer learning. Iâ€™m particularly interested in NLP applications of healthcare and have extensively worked on modeling and evaluating psychotherapy conversations using computational approaches such as recurrent neural networks and transformers. You can attach more information about my research via my publications.
